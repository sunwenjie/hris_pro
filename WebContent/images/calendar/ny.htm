<p>The Department of Civil Service has announced the designation of Floating Holidays for Contract Year 2014-15 and the 2015 Calendar of Legal Holidays. </p>
<p>The Governor’s Office of Employee Relations has advised that floating holidays have been designated in lieu of fixed holidays for Election Day, 2014 and Lincoln’s Birthday, 2015. </p>
<p>State offices will be open on Election Day, November 4, 2014 and Lincoln’s Birthday February 12, 2015. For CSEA, PEF and M/C employees, Election Day and Lincoln’s Birthday, will not be observed as fixed holidays and are to be treated as regular workdays. </p>
<p>Eligible full-time employees who are in pay status on November 4, 2014, may be credited with a floating holiday up to 7.5 or 8 hours, as appropriate, for that day. Eligible part-time employees may be credited with a floating holiday for the hours they are scheduled to work or actually do work on November 4, 2014 and/or February 12, 2015 (up to a maximum of 7.5 or 8 hours, as appropriate, for each day). </p>
<p>Eligible employees may use any floating holiday credit earned for Election Day 2014 beginning November 4, 2014 and ending with November 2, 2015, and for Lincoln’s Birthday beginning February 12, 2015 and ending February 11, 2016, respectively. </p>
<p>For NYSCOPBA and Council 82 employees, Election Day, November 4, 2014, and Lincoln’s Birthday, February 12, 2015, are not designated floating holidays. For employees in these units who are eligible to observe holidays, Election Day and Lincoln’s Birthday will be observed as fixed holidays. When such employees are required to work on these holidays, their benefits will be determined in the same manner as is currently followed for other holidays on which they are required to work. </p>
