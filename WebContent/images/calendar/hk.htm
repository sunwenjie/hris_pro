	* As Ching Ming Festival in 2015 falls on a Sunday, the following day will be designated as a general holiday in substitution.  However, as the day following Ching Ming Festival and Easter Monday fall on the same day, the next following day that is not itself a general holiday will be observed as an additional general holiday.
</p>
<p>	
	† The Government has, by legislation, designated 3 September 2015, the 70th anniversary day of the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression, on a one-off basis as an additional Statutory Holiday and General Holiday for 2015.
